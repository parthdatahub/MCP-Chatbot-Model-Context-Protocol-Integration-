# MCP-Chatbot-Model-Context-Protocol-Integration-

# MCP Chatbot 🧠 (Model Context Protocol Integration)

This project is a fully working chatbot powered by **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o** and designed to follow the principles of the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, enabling seamless integration of contextual data from various sources like:

- 📬 **Outlook Emails** (Inbox & Sent)
- 📁 **Local Files** (PDFs, Excel, DOCX, etc.)
- ☁️ **Google Drive** (read-only content)
- 💬 **Microsoft Teams** (chat support in progress)

## 🌐 Streamlit Chat UI
Run locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🚀 Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mcp-chatbot.git
cd mcp-chatbot
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
conda create -n MCP_Pro python=3.10 -y
conda activate MCP_Pro
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env`:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_outlook_app_id
OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
OUTLOOK_REDIRECT_URI=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient
```

---

## ☁️ Google Drive Setup
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Set up OAuth consent screen > Add scopes > Add test users
- Create OAuth Client ID (Desktop App) and download `credentials.json`
- Save it in the root project directory

Run:
```bash
python test_drive.py
```
This creates a `token_drive.pkl` for future Drive access.

## 📌 Purpose
This project showcases how the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** can be implemented in a real-world application to allow GPT models to consume dynamic, multi-source context — including emails, documents, and chat systems.

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer
This chatbot runs locally and does not store any uploaded content. Ensure proper token and data handling before deploying to production.
